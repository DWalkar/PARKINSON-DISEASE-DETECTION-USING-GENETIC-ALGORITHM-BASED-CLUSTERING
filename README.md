**Introduction**

       Parkinson’s disease (PD), or simply Parkinson’s, is a long-term degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that mainly affects the motor system. The symptoms usually emerge slowly, and as the disease worsens, non-motor symptoms become more common.
       
    The most obvious early symptoms are tremor, rigidity, slowness of movement, and difficulty with walking. Cognitive and behavioral problems may also occur with depression, anxiety, and apathy occurring in many people with PD.
    
      The cause of PD is unknown, with both inherited and environmental factors believed to play a role. Those with an affected family member are at an increased risk of getting the disease, with certain genes known to be inheritable risk factors.
      
      There is no proven cure available for this disease, however early identification of symptoms and proper care can slow down the effects.
      
      We used K-Means Clustering Algorithm combined with Genetic algorithm for Clustering. With the help of clustering we can identify the gens which show similar response to the disease.
      Here our motivation is to identify the group of genes which are responsible for Parkinson’s disease and find out the difference between effected (genes of the patient who have
Parkinson’s disease)and control gene(patient who does not have Parkinson’s disease)
 

**Results**

    In our project we worked on 100 gens. We tested fitness over “k values”(no. of clusters)
    We took values from 2 to √100 ~10
    We found the fittest chromosomes when k=10

**Selecting a gene from each cluster we got 10 genes with ID-Ref:**
